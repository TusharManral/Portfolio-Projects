The SQL script includes:
* Global and country-wise COVID-19 statistics

* Infection rate by country (total cases vs. population)
* Highest infection and death rates by continent
* Vaccination progress (using CTEs and views for rolling calculations)

-- Tableau Dashboard
After extracting data using SQL, Tableau was used to create a dashboard showcasing:
*Global case and death numbers
*Total deaths per continent
*Percent population infected per country
*Infection trends over time
